This is a copy of the LGPL shared openxls library.  It's no longer supported by the owners, but we're using it and are fixing things as we
encounter any problems.  If you find an issue, please open an issue on Github and/or provide a pull request.  For any issues logged, please
provide a small simple test case.  Small simple Excel files are also useful in dealing with the multitude of file formats and versions out
there.
