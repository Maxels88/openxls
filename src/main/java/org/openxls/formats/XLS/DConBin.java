/**
 * DConBin 0x1B5
 * <p/>
 * The DConBin record specifies a built-in named range that is a data source (1)
 * for a PivotTable or a data source (1) for the data consolidation settings of
 * the associated sheet.
 * <p/>
 * nBuiltin (1 byte): An unsigned integer that specifies the built-in defined
 * name for the range. MUST be a value from the following table:
 * Value 		Meaning
 * 0x00 		"Consolidate_Area"
 * 0x01 		"Auto_Open"
 * 0x02 		"Auto_Close"
 * 0x03 		"Extract"
 * 0x04 		"Database"
 * 0x05 		"Criteria"
 * 0x06 		"Print_Area"
 * 0x07 		"Print_Titles"
 * 0x08		"Recorder"
 * 0x09 		"Data_Form"
 * 0x0A 		"Auto_Activate"
 * 0x0B		"Auto_Deactivate"
 * 0x0C		"Sheet_Title"
 * 0x0D 		"_FilterDatabase"
 * <p/>
 * reserved1 (2 bytes): MUST be zero and MUST be ignored.
 * <p/>
 * reserved2 (1 byte): MUST be zero and MUST be ignored.
 * <p/>
 * cchFile (2 bytes): An unsigned integer that specifies the character count of
 * stFile. MUST be 0x0000, or greater than or equal to 0x0002. A value of 0x0000
 * specifies that the built-in defined name specified in nBuiltin has a workbook
 * scope and is contained in this file.
 * <p/>
 * stFile (variable): An DConFile structure that specifies the workbook or
 * workbook and sheet that contains the range specified in nBuiltin. This field
 * MUST exist if and only if the value of cchFile is greater than zero. If the
 * built-in defined name has workbook scope this field specifies the workbook
 * file that contains the built-in defined name and its associated range. If the
 * built-in defined name has a sheetâ€“level scope this field specifies both the
 * sheet name and the workbook file that contains the built-in defined name and
 * its associated range.
 * <p/>
 * unused (variable): An array of bytes that is unused and MUST be ignored. MUST
 * exist if and only if cchFile is greater than 0 and stFile specifies a
 * self-reference (the value of stFile.stFile.rgb[0] is 2). If the value
 * stFile.stFile.fHighByte is 0 the size of this array is 1. If the value of
 * stFile.stFile.fHighByte is 1 the size of this array is 2.
